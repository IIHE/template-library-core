# Templates for the core configuration modules

This is the last version of the legacy 13.1.x branch. It is intended to help sites
who have not yet been able to migrate all their nodes to 14.x.

__NOTE: starting with this release, AII 13.1.x is no longer supported: AII 14.6.0 should be used
instead and provides all the same features, including the ability to deploy both 13.1.x and 14.x machines.__

For details on how to use this branch, refer to Quattor [web site](http://quattor.org).
