# Templates for the core configuration modules

This repository is meant to ease up the migrations to new Quattor
releases.  All the needed templates will be found here, and will be
tagged in parallel to the releases.

To deploy a new release, either use this repository directly with git
subtree, or download the tarball for each release and put it in your
working copy.
