# Templates for configuring a specific Quattor release

This repository provides all the templates required to configure a specific version of the
Quattor client and the related configuration modules used by other parts of the template
library. There is one tag per Quattor version.

This repository is intended to be used in conjunction with other parts of the template
library (standard, os, grid...) to actually configure a system. To help putting together
everything needed in a way directly usable in a real configuration, it is recommended to
follow the procedure describe at 
https://trac.lal.in2p3.fr/Quattor/wiki/Download/QWGTemplates/Install#Upgradinganexistingrepository.

_Note: despite what suggest the script name/location, it is recommended to use this script whether you
are using SCDB or not to get all parts of the template library organized in a proper way._
